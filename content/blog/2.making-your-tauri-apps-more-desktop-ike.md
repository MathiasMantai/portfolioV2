Working with Tauri or any other Framework that uses a Webview has one big disadvantage: Your Application still acts like a Webapp even after compiling it into a Binary.

Therefore I have compiled a list of possible optimizations to make your Tauri App seem more “Desktop” like. 
(I will be updating this post when I think of more things to add)

<h1 class='text-xl text-[var(--linkColor)]'> 1) Remove various Key Events </h1>

There are various Key Events that we don’t want in our Desktop App. The following script will remove:

- Refreshing the page with F5
- Opening the Search Bar with CTRL + F

```js
window.addEventListener('keydown', function (e) {
    if ((e.ctrlKey && e.code == "KeyF") || e.code =="F5") { 
          e.preventDefault();
    }
})
```

<h1 class='text-xl text-[var(--linkColor)]'> 2) Turn off autocomplete for input fields </h1>

This point can be argued about. I personally don’t like chromium’s autocomplete so I always disable it.

To turn off autocomplete, just add this as an attribute to your input fields:

```html
<input autocomplete="none">
```
